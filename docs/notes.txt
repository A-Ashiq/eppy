----------
the Tutorial is built up in the ipython notebook file -> tutorial.ipynb
tutorial.ipynb imports from eppy. 
This import can be done only if eppy is installed in an virtual env.
Otherwise I'll have to hardcode the path names in the not the example code

The following lines describe how to install eppy to use while writing the tutorial
- make a new virtualenv -> eppytutorial (need to do only once)
- install ipython notebook (need to do only once)
    - easy_install ipython[all]
- install eppy in it (need to do only once - see notes below)
- do > workon eppytutorial
- workon tutorial
- cd docs
- ipython notebook (and you are ready to edit the docs in ipython)
- 


installing the most current eppy
- workon eppytutorial
- pip uninstall eppy (not needed first time)
- make an eppy egg
    - python setup.py sdist
    - cd docs
    - pip install ../dist/eppy-0.4.0.tar.gz 
        (version number may be different - check)
    - rm -r ./dist
    - rm -r ./eppy.egg-info
