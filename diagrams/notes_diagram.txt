Only one idd file will be open, although you can switch the idd file

need to make the data structure for multiple idf files to be open.
    - the idf is in data
    - we can have an array of data.
    - or a dictionary of data with file name as key.
    - or with (username, filename) as key.
    -
    - understand how this works in a django context
    - is it in two threads ?
