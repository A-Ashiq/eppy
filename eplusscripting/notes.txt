fuck ... I am trying to make this too complicated.
Keep it simple.
model, toprint, idd_info = idfreader(fname1, iddfile)
toprint = is the real model
model = allows you to access objects and change fields
    it does not allow you to add or delete objects
----
class IDF
idf = IDF(iddfilename)
model = idf.read(idffilename)
print model
str(model)
CRUD
model.create("ZONE", "zonename") # will be last zone in list of zones
model.read -> azone = model.objects["ZONE"][0]
model.update -> azone.Name="gumby"
model.delete(azone)

Agenda for call
- Status of pyenergyplus
- Next updates
- timeline
- Contractual issues

State of pyenergyplus:
----------------------
- Object API is complete
- Geometry API is complete
- HTML Table output reader complete
- Example files to illustrate API use is complete

Next updates:
two possibilities:
(time and resources may be enough for only one of the following)
1. streamline install and usage:
    - full install thru pip using the following command
        - pip install energyplus 
    - maybe restructure or code to make it simpler for a first time user.
2. Cookbook of recipes
    - Use the EEM list from this project to generate recipes.
    - Additional functions may be added to the API to facilitate the recipes
    
Contractual Issues
------------------
Contract asks for a report at each stage. What should I do for this.
How should I stage this ?


do a name change API
resizes window. 
3D-API
hmtl table -> better example
import.
node following code.
reference following code.
more examples
call in two weeks.

TODO.
draft of documentation.
node following code.
reference following code.

code review with Tuan and Nathan

2012-11-25
----------
some tasks in sequence.
1. factor the code in iddgaps.py
it is hard to make sense of it now.

2. Also it is not filling the gaps in all objects.
update to fix this

3. Once above is done, use it in bunch2data.py

Notes from conference call with Jason Glazer:
- Scripting library to be called PyEnergyplus
- Jason needs to use the software to generate files for the following criteria:
	1. internal loads (people, lights, process, schedules etc.)
	2. envelope (skin, construction, windows size, shading elements etc.)
	3. Climate
	4. Geometry
	5. HVAC
- All of the above except Climate can be done by pyenergyplus object API
- climate/weather file should be changed during the energy simulation
- To do this we need to be able to run energyplus from pyenergyplus
- then look at the results and be able to another run
- It would be useful to get a signal back from energyplus, when the simulation is complete

The tasks to be completed are:
1. Object API
2. Geometry API
3. Output Reader
4. HVAC API (beyond the Object API)
5. Documentation (code docs, user docs, tutorial)

Of the above we have proof of concept for 1, 2, 3.

Schedule:
- Dec 15th
	- Object API
	- corresponding user docs
- Jan 21st
	- Object API (any updates)
	- Geometry API
	- Output reader (atleast for ABUPS)
	- corresponding user docs
