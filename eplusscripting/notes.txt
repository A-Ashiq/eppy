include type conversions 
2013-01-03
----------
unit test needed for examples. - DONE

----------
code review with Tuan and Nathan

2012-11-25
----------
some tasks in sequence.
1. factor the code in iddgaps.py
it is hard to make sense of it now.

2. Also it is not filling the gaps in all objects.
update to fix this

3. Once above is done, use it in bunch2data.py

Notes from conference call with Jason Glazer:
- Scripting library to be called PyEnergyplus
- Jason needs to use the software to generate files for the following criteria:
	1. internal loads (people, lights, process, schedules etc.)
	2. envelope (skin, construction, windows size, shading elements etc.)
	3. Climate
	4. Geometry
	5. HVAC
- All of the above except Climate can be done by pyenergyplus object API
- climate/weather file should be changed during the energy simulation
- To do this we need to be able to run energyplus from pyenergyplus
- then look at the results and be able to another run
- It would be useful to get a signal back from energyplus, when the simulation is complete

The tasks to be completed are:
1. Object API
2. Geometry API
3. Output Reader
4. HVAC API (beyond the Object API)
5. Documentation (code docs, user docs, tutorial)

Of the above we have proof of concept for 1, 2, 3.

Schedule:
- Dec 15th
	- Object API
	- corresponding user docs
- Jan 21st
	- Object API (any updates)
	- Geometry API
	- Output reader (atleast for ABUPS)
	- corresponding user docs
