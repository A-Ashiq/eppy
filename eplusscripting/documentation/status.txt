Status of pyenergyplus on 2013-02-12

The pyenergyplus API is at a stage of completion where it can be used to generate and modify idf files for 1651-RP project. Results of the simulation can also be accessed through the API. Further fine tuning will help to streamline the process, but the basic functionality has been coded.

Object API
----------

- All objects can be accessed  and modified through the API
- Objects can be added or removed using the API
- works for all version of energyplus from version 1.1 to version 7.0
- Likely to work for future versions of energyplus without modifications
- All fields of an object are accessible using a dot notation::

example:-
zone = allobjects['ZONE'][0] # first zone object
zone.Name # is the field "Name" of zone

Geometry API
------------

Azimuth, tilt and area of any surface can be calculated using the function API

example:-
surface = allobjects['BUILDINGSURFACE:DETAILED'][0] # a surface
surface.azimuth # gives azimuth of surface
surface.tilt # gives tilt of surface
surface.area # gives area of surface

Output Reader
-------------

Output reader can read all tables in the HTML table file.
Table can be accessed by the title of the table.
Any cell in the table can also be accessed using the row and column index

pyenergyplus
------------

1. Object API
2. Geometry API
3. Output Reader
4. HVAC API (beyond the Object API)
5. Documentation (code docs, user docs, tutorial)

Completed on 2012-12-15:

- Object API 
- functions of Geometry API
- example files of the API

Object API
----------

- All objects can be accessed through the API
- works for all version of energyplus from version 1.1 to version 7.0
- Likely to work for future versions of energyplus without modifications
- All fields of an object are accessible using a dot notation::

zone = allobjects['ZONE'][0] # first zone object
zone.Name # is the field "Name" of zone

- field names from the idd file are used
- the field names from the idd file may be modified:
    - non-alphabetical characters are removed
    - "_" is used instead of spaces
- so "Floor Area" becomes zone.Floor_Area
- pyenergyplus can print the idf file to the terminal or save it to a file

Geometry API
------------

- all the functions needed have been written and unit tested
- they are yet to be incorporated into the API

TODO 

- add objects

TODO - not in scope, but worth doing

- import export
- name change propagated through references
- modify idf -> run eplus -> read output -> edit code -> run eplus
- map reduce unctions for cloud computing
