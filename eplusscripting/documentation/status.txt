1. Object API
2. Geometry API
3. Output Reader
4. HVAC API (beyond the Object API)
5. Documentation (code docs, user docs, tutorial)

Completed on 2012-12-15:

- Object API 
- functions of Geometry API
- example files of the API

Object API
----------

- All objects can be accessed through the API
- works for all version of energyplus from version 1.1 to version 7.0
- Likely to work for future versions of energyplus without modifications
- All fields of an object are accessible using a dot notation::

zone = allobjects['ZONE'][0] # first zone object
zone.Name # is the filed "Name" of zone

- field names from the idd file are used
- the field names from the idd file may be modified:
    - non-alphabetical characters are removed
    - "_" is used instead of spaces
- so "Floor Area" becomes zone.Floor_Area
- pyenergyplus can print the idf file to the terminal or save it to a file

Geometry API
------------

- all the functions needed have been written and unit tested
- they are yet to be incorporated into the API
