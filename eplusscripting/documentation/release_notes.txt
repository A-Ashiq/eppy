Object API
----------

Add an object to the model with the default values using the function:

    - modeleditor.addobject( ... )


- IDF reader does type conversions for object fields. Strings are converted to integers and floats where appropriate. 

Geometry API
------------

Azimuth, tilt and area of any surface can be calculated using the function API

example:-

    - surface = allobjects['BUILDINGSURFACE:DETAILED'][0] # a surface
    - surface.azimuth # gives azimuth of surface
    - surface.tilt # gives tilt of surface
    - surface.area # gives area of surface

Also see ex_functions.py for sample code

-------------

- Output reader can read all tables in the HTML table file.
- Table can be accessed by the title of the table.
- Any cell in the table can also be accessed using the row and column index
