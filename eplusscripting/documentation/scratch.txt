Energyplus models are made up of objects such as "BUILDING", "SITE:LOCATION", "ZONE", "PEOPLE", "LIGHTS".
There can be a number of "ZONE" objects, a number of "PEOPLE" objects and a number of "LIGHTS" object.

buildings = model["BUILDING"]
# finds all the objects in the model that are BUILDING objects

pyenergyplus holds these objects in a python structure called list.

Let us take a look at how lists work in python. 

fruits = ["apple", "orange", "bannana"] 
fruits is a list with three items in it.

to get the first item in fruits we say
fruits[0]
why "0" ?
because, unlike us, python starts counting from zero in a list

so if we say
print fruits[0]
it will print 
apple


if we say
firstfruit = fruits[0]
then if we say
print firstfruit
it will print
apple

We also can say
goodfruit = fruits[0]
redfruit = fruits[0]

print firstfruit
print goodfruit
print redfruit
print fruits[0]

will all print
apple

As you see, we can call that item in the list whatever we want. 

----------

In the same way let us do this

building = buildings[0]

building is the first item in buildings. Since "BUILDING" is an unique object, there is only one item in the list
