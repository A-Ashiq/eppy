Running the software
--------------------

I have described a opening a sample sketchup file and making an energyplus .idf file from it.

Sketchup
`````````

- make sure you have read the sketchup installation notes<locallink> #
- open sample file (you can read about how to build such a file here<alink>) #
- open the ruby console (this is not necessary, but it is nice to what is oing on) #
- run the plugin - export4eplus001 #
- save the file in a folder of your choice. Save it as "eplusinterface.txt"

EPlusInterface
``````````````

on a PC:
@@@@@@@@

- doubleclick on the "sk2eplus001.exe"
- open the file "eplusinterface.txt"
- save it as "eplusinterface.idf"

From command line (Mac, PC or Linux):
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

- put the file "eplusinterface.txt"  in the same folder as "sk2eplus001.py"
- python -v sk2eplus001.py eplusinterface.txt eplusinterface.idf
	- notice the "-v" option. 
	- of course the above line will work for "eplusinterface.txt" and "eplusinterface.idf" in the local folder
		- for a different location use the correct path names
- python 

EnergyPlus
``````````

- open the file "eplusinterface.idf" with EP-Launch
- you can view the information in "eplusinterface.idf"
- open "eplusinterface.idf" with WinEPDraw.exe
- make a dxf file and view it in ACAD or import it inot sketchup and view it
