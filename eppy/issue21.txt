When running the example from the documentation for forming a condenser loop, the inlet and outlet branches are not included in the branchlist.

loopname = "c_loop"
sloop = ['sb0', ['sb1', 'sb2', 'sb3'], 'sb4'] # supply side
dloop = ['db0', ['db1', 'db2', 'db3'], 'db4'] # demand side
theloop = hvacbuilder.makecondenserloop(theIdf, loopname, sloop, dloop)
The branchlists formed are:

BRANCHLIST,

c_loop Cond_Supply Branchs, !- Name
sb1, !- Branch 1 Name
sb2, !- Branch 2 Name
sb3; !- Branch 3 Name

BRANCHLIST,

c_loop Condenser Demand Branchs, !- Name
db1, !- Branch 1 Name
db2, !- Branch 2 Name
db3; !- Branch 3 Name

which is missing sb0, sb4, db0, db4.
