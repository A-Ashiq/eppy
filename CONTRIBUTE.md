If you are a contributor, consider using the following workflow:

-     an issue is opened
-     the issue is assigned to you
-     you make a branch from `develop` with a meaningful name such as "i57_licence" where #57 is the issue number
-     once the coding is complete and the tests pass, raise a pull request against the `develop` branch and tag the "release master" of the repository (release master is @santoshphilip at present)
-     "release master" will review and merge your changes into the `develop` branch
-     close the issue

If you are not a contributor:

-     ask to become a contributor

OR

-     fork this repository into your own repository
-     make a branch off the `develop` branch to work on your new feature
-     once the coding is complete, raise a pull request against the `develop` branch here
-     give the pull request a meaningful name, and mention any issues that it addresses (using the issue number, e.g. "Resolves #86, also see #57")
-     once the code has been reviewed and tests are passing it will be merged into `develop`
